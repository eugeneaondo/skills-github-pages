1. Observer Pattern: This lets one object (subject) notify many other objects (observers) when there's a change. Imagine a news source alerting subscribed users about updates.

2. Factory Pattern: This helps create objects without specifying the exact class beforehand. Think of a car factory that can produce different car models based on your request.

3. Adapter Pattern: This bridges the gap between incompatible interfaces. Like a plug adapter that lets a device from one region work in another.

4. Decorator Pattern: This adds new functionality to an existing object dynamically without changing its structure. Imagine customizing a car with add-on features.

5. Singleton Pattern: This ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point. Like a system-wide settings manager.
